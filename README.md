# Blender2NieR

## VERY IMPORTANT
My addon Nier2Blender_2.8 is a REQUIREMENT. Without it, nothing will work, you will understand why. <br>
https://github.com/WoefulWolf/Nier2Blender_2.8 <br>
THIS IS ALSO STILL IN DEVELOPMENT BUT IS AS STABLE AS IT CURRENTLY CAN BE. If any updates break something that worked in the past, please let me know immediately. Every update is intended to be fully functional, the next just better than the prior.

## Tutorials and a Proper Readme will come, eventually...
#### For now you should just understand these basic rules:
* Watch https://youtu.be/Mr-zmXAwM5g for a very basic example video.
* Any model you wish to edit or replace must first be imported using my above-mentioned addon WITH materials/shaders. Thus DTT import is recommended to have it do everything automatically for you. <br>
* THINGS YOU SHOULD NOT CHANGE (unless you know what you are doing) include object names, material names, armatures or any custom properties on objects, materials, bones, armatures, etc. <br>
* An object cannot have more than one material. (Thus using the original from import is recommended, textures are separate). <br>
* All unused materials should be purged before export (something I might fix in the future, but not a priority). <br>
* When working with bone weights, one vertex cannot belong to more than 4 groups (in other words have weights belonging to more than 4 bones) <br>
* All meshes must be triangulated. (This gets done automatically, but you can do it yourself to ensure no unexpected results.) <br>
* After exporting, in-game the model might sometimes have flipped normals - you will have to flip them in Blender and re-export, sorry. <br>
* Open the Blender Console Window when exporting, this allows you to see its progress and any export errors. <br>
* A lot of my code is put together with duct-tape and instant ramen, thus it is unoptimized, ugly and straight up fucked at places. :)
