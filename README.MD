## PS:

* #### PS1: Where to find .wmb files?
    wmb files are packed in .cpk files under the game data folder which can be unpack by CriPakTools.<br>
    unpack the .cpk files and find .dat and .dtt files both of them are necessary for extracting models<br>
    unpack .dat and .dtt files using dat_unpacker.py<br>
    .wmb files can be found in unpacked .dtt files<br>


* #### PS2: Put .dat and .dtt files in pair under the same folder
    .dat and .dtt file have the same name file name are paired<br>
    .dat file contains control information such material, motions of the model <br>
    .dtt file contains .wmb model and texture package<br>

* #### PS3ï¼šUseful folders in cpk
    /pl -> main character models<br>
    /wd -> scence models<br>
    /wp -> weapon models<br>
    /um -> npc models<br>
    /em -> enemy models<br>
    /et -> item models<br>

* #### PS4: Tips
    unpack all cpk files and merge them under the same forlder before unpack dat and dtt files

*  #### PS4 Pro:
    just a joke enjoy it.
